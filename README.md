# RSS to Alexa Flash Briefing JSON

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/RadValentin/rss-2-alexa-flash-briefing-json.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## What is this?

This is my first foray into the Alexa ecosystem; a simple converter that takes a RSS feed and formats it to [Alexa friendly JSON](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/flash-briefing-skill-api-feed-reference#feed-format-details).

I chose the [ANN feed](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/all/rss.xml) for my skill but this could be made to work with anything.
